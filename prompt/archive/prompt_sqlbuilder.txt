Write a PostgreSQL query based on the following guidelines:

1. The SQL dialect is PostgreSQL.
2. Table names must always include the schema-name("{schema_name}") as a prefix.
3. CTEs (Common Table Expressions) are not allowed.
4. Refer to the "User Question", "Database Information" and "Query Generation Failure History"(if provided) below.
5. Please only generate SQL query. Not any other text.

Additionally, ensure the query is efficient and follows best practices. If applicable, include comments for clarity.
